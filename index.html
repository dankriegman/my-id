                    <h2>About Dr. Kriegman</h2>
                    <p>I was the Chief Psychologist at the Massachusetts Treatment Center for Sexually Dangerous Offenders, as well as the Clinical Director for the maximum-security, intensive-treatment unit for adolescents in Boston.

<p>At the Treatment Center, I evaluated and treated rapists, child molesters, and murderers. On many hundreds of occasions in various courts (e.g., MA, NY, NH, IA, and the Federal Circuit), I have been deemed an “expert witness” regarding the risks posed by men and women facing involuntary commitment due to mental illness. I supervised the evaluations and/or testified in the trials of thousands of people facing “one day to life” commitment as a “sexually dangerous person.”

<p>I was a faculty member at the Massachusetts Institute for Psychoanalysis, and I taught psychology at SUNY at Buffalo, Massasoit College, Lesley College, and Boston University. I was a founder of the Psychoanalytic Couple and Family Institute of New England, and I am the creative consultant behind the acclaimed <a href="https://www.edgelinefilms.com/">Edgeline Films</a> (Showtime) docu-series, <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/arts/television/couples-therapy-showtime-review.html">Couples Therapy</a></i>.”

<p>In addition to my published books and articles, I have served as a peer reviewer for major journals such as the <i>Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association</i> and the <i>International Journal of Psychoanalysis</i>. I have been an invited, plenary speaker at international conferences on psychoanalytic treatment.

<p>As a clinician writing within the framework of evolutionary biology—our only scientific theory of creation—I seek to integrate our understanding of the biological functions (the <i>distal</i>, ultimate events that shaped us) with our lived, human experience (the <i>proximal</i> motivations that today guide our behavior and shape the meaning of our lives).

<p>At <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com">Mad in America</a>, I blog about the politics of diagnosis and treatment. Taking an evolutionary biological view, as a practicing clinical psychologist I explore the negotiation of conflicting realities that lies at the heart of successful treatment, and how a healing discipline can help prevent the dictating of meaning and truth from one party to another.

                    <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQQ9Y4X5">THE BOOK OF WAR: The Evolutionary Biology of Racism, Religious Hatred, Nationalism, Terrorism, and Genocide</a></h3>
                    
<p>Has the world gone crazy? The intractable MAGA-WOKE divide. The brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Hamas-Israel catastrophe. Iranian nuclear ambitions. Saber rattling China.

<br><br>Today, more than ever we need to understand why we so often join together in groups to go to war.

<br><br>The amount of effort and resources humans put into killing one another is utterly mind-boggling. A careful reading of our history shows that—after obtaining sustenance, mating, and rearing offspring—we invest most of our life energy in murderous, coalitional aggression. Up until now, there has been no sufficient explanation for this fact: Human behavior appears to have been designed (shaped by natural selection) to include what is apparently the most maladaptive behavior imaginable.

<br><br>Furthermore, the beliefs and reasoning that guide such horrific behavior have all the characteristics of psychotic delusions. So, how could it be that history demonstrates that our devotion to murdering one another based on utter nonsense has evolved and become part of the core of the human psyche?

<br><br>Dr. Daniel Kriegman, a clinical psychologist and evolutionary biologist is the co-author of <i>The Adaptive Design of the Human Psyche: Psychoanalysis, Evolutionary Biology and the Therapeutic Process</i>, an acclaimed "brilliantly argued book. The treatment of the biology is expert" (Robert Trivers) and considered "essential reading for anyone interested in the psychodynamics of the mind" (Irven DeVore, Chair, Dept. of Anthropology, Harvard University). Using a cutting-edge application of modern evolutionary biology, Dr. Kriegman presents the first complete answer to the conundrum of human inhumanity. The unavoidable conclusion is that we have been designed by millions of years of natural selection to join together in groups that use ethnocentric racism, religious, and quasi-religious systems of belief to guide organized, intergroup violence.

<br><br>During the evolution of our species, such tribal madness and mass murder of outsiders can be shown to have been highly adaptive. As our species evolved, a tendency to denigrate and murder the subhuman “others” was reinforced when the winners (most often the perpetrators) survived, prospered, and went on to increase their lineage, while the losers were typically enslaved, decimated, and/or exterminated. <i>The Book of War</i> explains how the tendency to engage in murderous warfare based on our shared, tribal identities co-evolved alongside the burgeoning, symbol using, human brain. The ways the semi-social human animal constructs personal meaning and group identities become clarified in an evolutionary analysis.

<br><br>Modern humans have been around for 300,000 years or so. Yet it is only with the  recent advent of Darwin’s theory of evolution that, for the first time, humanity has had what can be called a "scientific theory of creation." And it is just during the past 50 years that this powerful explanatory theory has been turned toward the study of human behavior. Today, the elaboration of the breakthrough explanations of evolutionary biology has provided a foundation for understanding much of why people believe and act as they do.

<br><br>Yet, it is over just the past thirty years that many evolutionists have been turning to focus specifically on the violence that has been endemic in human history. Why are we so violent? Why do we spend so much of our life energy and resources on murdering one another? Why do we so readily form and hold the insane beliefs about US and THEM that facilitate such horrors? It is only in the last one ten-thousandth of our history that humanity has had a valid understanding of our delusional tendency to engage in tribal violence. We were designed (by natural selection) to be tribal supremacists who believe that we should replace them.

<br><br>In addition to understanding the evolutionary history of warfare, <i>The Book of War</i> examines the psychology that motivates murderous intergroup conflict. This new understanding presents us with a real foundation for solving this horrific problem.</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D29SW2RB">THE BOOK OF MONOGAMY: A Tantric Guide for Men Revealing the Techniques for Having Perfect Orgasms with One Woman for the Rest of Your Life (and for Women, the Operating Manual Your Husband Didn't Come With)</a></h3>
                    <p>This is the marriage manual that works. From a renowned couples therapist, comes a new understanding of how to create lifelong marital bliss.
<br><br>Aren’t men naturally polygamous? Is traditional monogamy a reactionary anachronism? Can a man find complete, lifelong, sexual satisfaction with just one woman? Is holy matrimony just a fanciful canard full of holes?

<br><br>Indeed, it has been argued that the formerly absurd notion of marrying for love was a twentieth century invention. Could this fad have run its course? Could this unnatural, fragile arrangement account for the high frequency of divorce? With the continuing turmoil over same sex marriage—not to mention rapidly emerging polyamory arrangements—many people wring their hands worried about the fate of marriage, the family, and especially the children.

<br><br>Into this cultural maelstrom, steps a marital therapist and <i>The Book of Monogamy</i>.

<br><br>In addition to being a highly regarded couples therapist who was the creative consultant behind the hit Showtime series <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/arts/television/couples-therapy-showtime-review.html">Couples Therapy</a></i>, Dr. Kriegman was also the Chief Psychologist at the maximum security Treatment Center for Sexually Dangerous Men. Without pulling any punches, without denying the darker side of human sexuality, Dr. Kriegman not only presents the case for monogamy, he also offers a unique look at human sexuality and explains how hypersexually charged males can find lifelong, marital bliss with one woman.

<br><br>Dr. Daniel Kriegman—a much published psychologist and evolutionary biologist—demonstrates that, despite the well-known male longing for multiple sexual partners, despite the evidence of widespread infidelity, male sexual satisfaction reaches its ultimate glory when a man is in love with a woman. In a down-to-earth, Westernized version of Tantric practice, Dr. Kriegman elucidates how a man can discover the deepest meaning of his life: Only when head over heels in love can a man know the transcendent wonder and consummate joy that is his most profound longing. This is a commonplace truth: Such love is the essence of every great love story. In <i>The Book of Monogamy</i>, the reader learns how ordinary men and women can live in such marital bliss.

<br><br>Dr. Kriegman presents a story of discovery based on scholarly research, extensive work with his patients, as well as his personal experience in love. <i>The Book of Monogamy</i> takes John Gray’s tame <i>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</i> into the 21st century to produce a guide for monogamous marriage and fidelity built around overt, male, sexual worship of one woman.

<br><br>In a no-holds-barred examination of marriage and human sexuality, Dr. Kriegman presents an uninhibited manual that shows men how to remain ecstatically in love with their wives for a long as they both shall live. The marital result is an endless and plentiful series of perfect orgasms that, for men, form the unshakable core of truly loving relationships.

<br><br>During courtship, couples typically find themselves in a state of heightened sexual attraction. Once the relationship starts to include sexual activity, virtually every time they see one another, the new lovers are drawn into physical contact.

<br><br>And then the honeymoon ends. The couple starts to take the relationship for granted as they turn their focus to other life tasks. While this is normal and to some degree inevitable—courting and mating must coexist with other vital activities—honeymoon’s end is also coupled with greater emotional distance and heightened conflict. Dr. Kriegman asks the reader to consider what it would be like if the honeymoon could last forever. <i>The Book of Monogamy</i> is a realistic, practical manual showing how to make that happen. </p>

                    <img src="BoY ebook.jpg" alt="Book Cover">
                    <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1YCX9PK">The (first) Book of Yo: Meditations on Godhood, An Exploration of Mystical Experience, and Proof of the Existence of God</a></h3>
                    <p>This groundbreaking work presents Yoism: The World’s First Open-Source Religion. Borrowing from the best ideas, rituals, and symbols found in religions, enlightenment philosophy, and modern science, Yoism brings together the vital essence of human spirituality and wisdom.

<br><br>A co-creation by all its followers, Yoism bases its beliefs on the direct experiences available to all members of the community. Modeled on open-source projects such as Wikipedia, Yoans are all invited to have a voice in creating Yoism. Yoans scour the vast resources of human knowledge and bring together the best spiritual understandings that have been created by humanity.

<br><br><b>In the beginning was the Bang . . .</b>

<br><br>For example, Yoans have rewritten the tale found in the Book of Genesis so that the Yoan story of creation comports with modern physics and the Big Bang. While based in empirically verifiable science, Yoism came into being after Dr. Kriegman first saw "God" in 1969. In <i>The First Book of Yo</i>, he articulates what happens when an empirical scientist sees God and then creates a religion based only on beliefs that can be verified by each participant. While Yoism was still just beginning to develop, open-source movements began to take form utilizing the internet and the new social media. Realizing the extraordinary potential of a movement that could create something as marvelous as Wikipedia, Yoans embraced this new social technology and Yoism became the world’s first open-source religion.

<br><br>With thousands of followers all over the world, Yoism is being recognized as providing something new, unique, and in many cases, life changing. There have been articles about Yoism in <a href="https://github.com/dankriegman/my-id/blob/main/BostonGlobeArticle.jpg"><i>The Boston Globe</i>, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Search Magazine</i>. There was a 2005 reference to an early yoism.org page in <i>The New York Times</i> that led to Yoism’s crude, unpolished website receiving millions of visits.

<br><br><b>The Apostle to the Atheists</b>

<br><br>And now, in <i>The First Book of Yo</i>, Dr. Kriegman bears witness to the experience of seeing God and explores how one can make sense out of profound religious experience while remaining true to the principles of science. This book explores and illuminates the mystical experience that many have experienced through the use of psychedelic entheogens.

<br><br>In addition to his published books and many articles in peer reviewed, academic, professional journals, Dr. Kriegman has served as a peer reviewer for major journals such as the <i>Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association</i> and the <i>International Journal of Psychoanalysis</i>. He was the Chief Psychologist for the Massachusetts Treatment Center for Sexually Dangerous Persons where he evaluated and treated rapists, child molesters, and murderers. To this day, he is frequently deemed an “expert witness” in court regarding dangerousness. Dr. Kriegman has supervised the evaluations and testified in the trials of thousands of people facing involuntary commitment. He’s been an invited plenary speaker at international conferences on psychoanalytic treatment. Dr. Kriegman is a well-known therapist who is often sent the cases of some of the most difficult patients when other senior clinicians find themselves stymied.

<br><br>In short, Dr. Kriegman is a respected, levelheaded, clinical psychologist as evidenced by the judgements of mental health professionals and by hundreds of rulings by state and federal court judges.

<br><br>And now he is ready to tell his story of his encounter with God. Along the way, he will present the first irrefutable proof of God’s existence. In straightforward, down-to-earth language, Dr. Kriegman explains mystical experience and proves the existence of something beyond the known world that is the source of reality as we know it. Then he describes what it means to live with God. </p>
